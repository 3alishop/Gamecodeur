We'll meet again soon, Ashley!"

HALL_NATHAN_MEET3_2	"Knowledge comes from trial and error, Ashley..."
HALL_ASHLEY_MEET3_3	"I'm being tested?"
HALL_NATHAN_MEET3_4	"Yes. Since ghosts began to spread through our world, the Fraternity has been looking for the Key - they think it's you!"

HALL_NATHAN_MEET4_6	"Free one more soul. Only then will the Fraternity be certain of your ability to save the world."
HALL_ASHLEY_MEET4_7	"There are 6 ghosts, and this will be the 5th! Who can the 6th be?"
HALL_NATHAN_MEET4_8	"You will find out, Ashley!"
HALL_NATHAN_MEET4_9	"I hope it won't be too late for us."

ATTIC_PENDANT	"The pendant is now in your inventory."
ATTIC_NATHAN1	"Thank you, Ashley."
ATTIC_ASHLEY1	"Where's the 6th ghost?"
ATTIC_NATHAN2	"I'm the 6th ghost, but I have no need to be free. The land of the dead is my kingdom..."
ATTIC_NATHAN3	"The Fraternity sent you here, but I was the one who used your powers as a medium!"
ATTIC_NATHAN4	"You captured the energy of those souls in my pendant!"
ATTIC_ASHLEY2	"But... Who are you then, if you're not part of the Fraternity?"
ATTIC_NATHAN5	"I was a medium like you... Then I discovered the powers of darkness. The Fraternity damned me, accusing me of sorcery."
ATTIC_NATHAN6	"They want you since you are the Key - the most powerful medium in the world, able to reach into the afterlife."
ATTIC_NATHAN7	"Join with me! Our alliance will give us absolute power over the world to bring about complete chaos!"
ATTIC_ASHLEY4	"No! I refuse to be part of this! You got swallowed by darkness and now you want to bring the whole world down with you!"
ATTIC_NATHAN8	"You have no choice! THE FRATERNITY WILL EXPEL YOU AS IT DID ME! YOU MUST ESCAPE THEIR GRASP!"
ATTIC_ASHLEY5	"LIES!"
ATTIC_NATHAN9	"Then the Fraternity won't have you either! With the energy of the 5 ghosts, I have the power to fling you to Hell..."
ATTIC_NATHAN10	"NOW!"

ATTIC_END_NATHAN1	"What spell is this...?!"
ATTIC_END_ASHLEY1	"You underestimated me, Nathan. I feel an extraordinary power within me."
ATTIC_END_ASHLEY2	"You helped me understand why I felt different - thank you."
ATTIC_END_ASHLEY3	"I am the Key. Shadows are harmless to me."
ATTIC_END_ASHLEY5	"Now they've come to take you away..."
ATTIC_END_NATHAN2	"Nooooooooooooooooo!"

THEEND_SPEECH_1 Ashley, you are now one of us. Your wisdom and immense power have brought the deceitful Nathan to his knees.
THEEND_SPEECH_2 Your real struggle begins now...
THEEND_SPEECH_3 But... Nathan is no more!
THEEND_SPEECH_4 You're right. Bodily he is no more, but his spirit is alive...
THEEND_SPEECH_5 The world is still in great danger. You must be at the ready.
THEEND_SPEECH_6 Feel the force within you.
THEEND_SPEECH_7 What must I do?

EGYPT_NEFERES_MEETHERES2	Mother, you had me assassinated?
EGYPT_HERES_MEETHERES3	"No, my son, but I admit I was involved in plotting of your murder. I was blinded by thoughts of the riches your brother promised me after your death."

she returned to her tribe... the one you gave orders to slaughter!"

DIARY_ZEPPELINS	"Since the beginning of the phenomenon, the situation across the world has worsened. The government is using repressive methods that I don't approve of. Haunted houses are sometimes set fire to! Many leave their homes behind - this is no solution to the problem. Much of the city is deserted."
DIARY_OUT	"The house in my dream really exists...

This morning I received a strange envelope. There was an address written on it, but it wasn't mine. Inside there was a key and the plan of a house. I went to the address indicated and yes, it was the house in my dream. Something beyond mere curiosity is compelling me to go inside and figure out this mystery..."

DIARY_HALL1	"I went inside...

In front of me was a strange person named Nathan. I think he must be one of the ghosts the newspapers spoke about. The ground shook and I was frightened. Isaac was too, and he ran upstairs. I heard Nathan speak - he seems to know me. He also seems to want to help me, but his intentions are unclear!"

DIARY_HALL2	"Nathan gave me a pendant and an assignment.

He says I have to free six ghosts. I have no idea what he means, only that he seems well informed. He knows who I am, or at least... what I am! I'm locked in - it's impossible to walk away now.

And anyhow, I want to know!"

DIARY_LIVING1	"I don't know what will happen to me, but it sure is strange to meet a ghost. I felt something indescribable. I know I can help the ghost of the Incan warrior I met. But how is the statuette so important? It seems I have to rebuild it to save him. I'll understand eventually. I know I can free him!"
DIARY_LIVING2	"I saved Yumanco! It was like a dream. He went through a sort of trial, beyond life on earth, and I was there with him, inhabiting him... a terrifying experience. I felt a limitless force, and was afraid that my own life had come to an end.
I'm exhausted but I'll get my strength back.
One of the gems on the pendent has activated..."

DIARY_NATHAN2	"Nathan has asked me to trust him, but does he want to help or hinder? Am I really held prisoner here as he says?

I've no idea who Nathan is. He's certainly not a ghost like Yumanco! 

I thought he was a member of the Fraternity but I'm having doubts."

DIARY_BASEMENT1	"Another soul - in the cellar. A Japanese lady who seems lost. How can it be that I feel her suffering?

She wants me to give her something. I'll look for it in the cellar.

The more progress I make, the more I feel drawn into the unknown..."

DIARY_BASEMENT2	"The soul of the Japanese lady, Natsumi, is free now.

I've discovered that I have newfound powers. I'm able to mediate beyond life on earth!

Nathan's telling the truth - I am different. And I'm afraid."

DIARY_DINING1	"The third ghost scolded me and was most unpleasant. But I quickly saw he was hiding a more sensitive side, as well as deep sorrow. He too needs to put things right.

I have to restore the model galleon display to its former glory. Perhaps with this broken vase!?"

DIARY_DINING2	"Did Samuel Murray really think I was a pirate? How funny! When I was a young girl I dreamed of becoming the captain of a pirate ship and sailing the seas! Perhaps in another life! Anyway, I'm happy to have helped the poor buccaneer."
DIARY_NATHAN3	"I no longer trust Nathan. All I did was ask him if he was part of the Fraternity, and he didn't answer. I thought he had been sent to guide me. Why the silence? 
I need to be on my guard until I know more!"

DIARY_BATHROOM1	"I managed to get upstairs and things have become complicated. The ghost in the bathroom is a Pharaoh, and seems to be in a deep sleep in the bath!

He's holding a parchment in his hands. I have to find a way to wake him."

DIARY_BATHROOM2	"The Pharaoh's ghost revealed to me why all these ghosts can't reach the afterlife. Now that he knows everything about his life, he can rest in peace. 

Truth liberates the soul!"

DIARY_NATHAN4	"Nathan sends shivers down my spine. He tells me he's helping me, and asks me to join him.

I sense danger, but I also feel my own strength.

I'm stronger than him, I can feel it.

And he knows it."

DIARY_ROOM1	"The monk in the bedroom can't pray without his Bible. Perhaps Isaac can help me?

There's another problem - I feel a curious presence here, in the mirror. It's not human, and I sense it's rather nasty..."

DIARY_POLTERGEIST	"The presence in the mirror is a poltergeist. Half ghost, half demon, it is wild and without purpose, its soul forever corrupt.

I seem to somehow have the power to drive poltergeists away."

DIARY_ROOM2	"Guilt poisons the soul. The monk died while his spirit was tortured by his errors. But now he rests in peace.

I see why forgiveness is so important in all religions."

DIARY_ATTICDOOR	"The door to the attic is closed. In my dream, the attic seemed to represent a great danger, but I know I must go inside.

I can make out a pentagram on the door - it's the wrong way round, like in black magic. Perhaps I have to reverse the ritual!?"

DIARY_ATTIC	"I know for certain that Nathan's trying to trap me. I still don't know his intentions and what exactly he wants from me.

He's been guiding me here all along. Even so, I can't abandon everything now."

ENVELOPE_PARVIS	"There is more to this world than meets the eye. Beyond reality there is where we dream, and beyond that, where we hope to live.

If you find this message then you have been dreaming. You have been summoned here to fulfil our hopes.

There will be no satisfactory end to the conflicts that some have instigated.

Are you the Key?

The Fraternity of Mediums"

ENVELOPE_CORRIDOR	"
The corridor linking the three worlds is blocked. Movement between them has been halted.
The dead are circulating among the living. The living pursue their lives aimlessly.
Our goal cannot be revealed, as the forces called upon do not belong to the living.
Using dreams to transport thoughts, the Fraternity of Mediums is seeking living beings capable of passing between worlds and putting time back into the hands of Chronos. 

(Are you capable? The road is a long one...)"

ENVELOPE_LIVINGROOM	"
Souls that are forbidden access to the afterlife exist in a state of severe suffering and interfere with the world of the living using supernatural means. Trapped, they exhaust energy vital to the living.

Only the energies contained within their earthly belongings can give them access to the afterlife. Gifted mediums can re-energize these belongings when they travel the corridors between life and afterlife."

ENVELOPE_BASEMENT	"
The higher world cannot welcome souls that have unresolved issues in their lives. Real light is impure if it is tainted with the shadows of darkness. 

Darkness resolves nothing.

Mortal - the light of your soul can enter the troubled thoughts of those that roam between life and death. Give them eternal purity so they reach the afterlife."

ENVELOPE_DININGROOM	"
Mediums communicate with the dead and know how to help them. Rare are those with the gift to accompany the souls on the road that leads them to the afterlife. A key will not suffice to cross that threshold - YOU must BE the Key.
The Fraternity of Mediums knows that the Key is among mortals. The search is not over until a mortal soul steps up."

ENVELOPE_FIRSTFLOOR	"
Beware of those that use sorcery. While it does enable you to reach the corridors between life and afterlife, sorcery is fueled by chaos and undermines the restoration of earthly balance. 
Long ago, one of our brothers lost his way in the darkness of sorcery, and we fought him and drove him out. 
Since then, the Fraternity is extremely vigilant in its search for the Key."

ENVELOPE_ATTIC	"

He that mislead his brothers and used witchcraft is disloyal and a traitor. He is no medium.
The door to the Kingdom of the Dead is closed to him forever. Never will he reach Thanatos.
Disloyal is the sorcerer that no-one can reach or bring down. He is neither fire nor ice, neither living nor dead, but his power is immense. He wishes to possess the Key, as only the Key has the power to reverse his wrongdoings."
